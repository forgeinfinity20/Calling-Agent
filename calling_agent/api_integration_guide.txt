To connect the Calling Agent with an external calling API:

1. Use your API provider’s SDK (e.g., Twilio REST API).
2. Authenticate using API key and secret.
3. Define endpoints for initiating and ending calls.
4. Integrate agent responses to trigger these endpoints.
5. Use logs and metadata to update call_logs.txt dynamically.
